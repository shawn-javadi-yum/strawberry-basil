# Would be nice patterns
## Git
  - Commits should be descriptive, and explain changes contained in them
  
  - PRs should be kept small to make for an easier review process
## React
  - React components should be as dumb as possible
    - Logic should be abstracted away to redux/containers/util functions/api/etc
      - Good:
        - TBD
      - Bad:
        - TBD
  - Avoid using index.js for React component names
    - This will help avoid having 10+ index.js tabs open in the editor
    - It will also help make the components searchable using fuzzy search
## Code
  - Use meaningful/descriptive names
    - Bad:
      - ```javascript
          ps.map(p => {})
    - Good:
      - ```javascript
          products.map(product => {})
  - Functions/classes should ideally have one responsibility.
    - Single responsibility functions are easier to reuse/test/read/refactor
    - Use functional decomposition to abstract away logic
    - Bad:
      - ```javascript
          function renderRedProducts(products) {
              const filteredProducts = products.map(...)
                  .filter(...)
                  .someOtherFunction(id)
              .
              .
              .
              .
                // Some more data mapping/logic ^
              return filteredProducts.map(product => <SomeElement />)
          }
    - Good:
      - ```javascript
        - function getRedProducts(products) {
              const filteredProducts =  products.map(...)
                  .filter(...)
                  .someOtherFunction(id)
              .
              .
              .
              .
                // Some more data mapping/logic ^

              return filteredProducts
          }

          function renderRedProducts(products) {
              const productsToRender = getRedProducts(products)
              return productsToRender.map(product => <SomeElement />)
          }

  - Encapsulate boolean expressions for readability
    - Bad:
      - ```javascript
        if (someArray.length > 2 && someArray[0].id === "someId") {
            ...
        }
    - Good:
      - ```javascript
        const isSomeCondition = someArray.length > 2 && someArray[0].id === "someId";

        if (isSomeCondition) {
            ...
        }
  - Prefer using native JS features over outside sources/lodash
    - Modern JS Array/Number/String prototype functions are faster and generally more reliable
    - This is specially true on the mobile side since we don't have to worry about browser compatibility 
    - If we do decide to add an outside library it should be voted on as a team first before being added
    - On flip side no need to reinvent the wheel from scratch if an outside library can save time/provide an already tested/stable solution
  - Function names should explain what they do
      - Bad:
      - ```javascript
          function filterItems(items) {...} // when i pass items here what's actually being filtered out?
    - Good:
      - ```javascript
        - function filterRedItems(items) {...}
  - Variable names should explain what's been done to them/what they contain
    - Bad:
      - ```javascript
          const reducedItems = items.reduce(...) // What did we reduce to?
    - Good:
      - ```javascript
        - const blueItems = items.reduce(...)
  - Avoid long chains of functions/deeply nested functions
    - this example is obviously primitive and simplified/exaggerated to showcase the concept
    - This is obviously only a problem if there is a lot going inside the functions you are chaining. no need to seperate one liners.
    - Bad:
      - ```javascript
          return products.map(product => {
              ...
              ...
              ...
              ...
              ...
              ...
              ...
              ...
              return someModifier
          })
          .map(modifier => {
              ...
              ...
              ...
              ...
              ...
              return goodModifiers
          })
          .reduce((someGoodModifiers, modifier) => {
              ...
              ...
              ...
              ...
              ...
          }, []).length === 0 || []
    - Good:
      - ```javascript
        - const modifiers = products.map(product => {
              ...
              ...
              ...
              ...
              ...
              ...
              ...
              ...
              return someModifier
          })

          const goodModifiers =  modifiers.map(modifier => {
              ...
              ...
              ...
              ...
              ...
              return goodModifiers
          })

          const modifiersToCheck = reduce((someGoodModifiers, modifier) => {
              ...
              ...
              ...
              ...
              ...
          }, [])

          return modifiersToCheck.length === 0 || []
